This is the first post on this blog. Here's a quick look at how code blocks render.

## A CSS example

```css
:root {
  --accent: #c47a3a;
  --bg: #1a1a1a;
}

body {
  background: var(--bg);
  color: white;
}
```

## Some JavaScript

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

And here is some inline `code` in a sentence.

## What's next

More posts coming soon.
